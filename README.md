# Overview

As a software engineer I want to improve every day and give the best performance I can to improve people's life, also I want to learn as much technologies so I decided to learn three new different programming languages to see how the syntax vary from one programming language to another, I want to make programs that bring solutions to daily problems.

I made a program for encrypting and descrypting files, to secure important or sensitive information, the program use aes-gcm crate to perform this.

I write this program to learn more about cryptography, how to encrypt and decrypt information what are the tools required, what the crater functions uses to encrypt and decrypt, if it is secure to use this kind of tools.

# Development Environment

I've used VSCode as code editor, rust-analyzer, and code runner extensions

The programming language I chose was Rust, and the libraries (called crates in Rust) were rand, hex, aes-gcm, and dialoguer.

# Future Work

- Make a GUI with the program to make it more friendly from the user
- Support for encrypting multiple files
- Generate keys more securely
